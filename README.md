## 📌 What is Smart SOS?  
Ever fallen, called for help, and got bombarded with **"What’s your location? What happened? What’s your blood type?"**  
By the time they get through their questionnaire, you might as well **self-heal like Wolverine.** 🦸

**Smart SOS fixes this.** One tap → Instant location sharing → Network priority → Verified call. Help is **on the way.**

## 🚀 Code Coming Soon
